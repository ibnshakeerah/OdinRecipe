        <li>In the bowl, add the mashed potatoes and lemon juice. Make small to medium-sized patties out of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Oil in a pan is now heating up over a medium flame. Then shallow fried the patties in the oil until both sides are golden brown.</li>

        <li>Take a hamburger bun and cut it in half. The lettuce should be positioned on top of some butter.</li>
